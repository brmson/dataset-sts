1,MEAP_2005_8_28,"Read the article below and answer questions 27 through 29 . Spiders have been around for over 400 million years . Early spiders mainly used their silk to construct a hiding place . Today , although many spiders—such as giant tarantulas , trap-door spiders , and some other species—still use their silk mainly for shelter , most build various types of aerial webs . The primary victims of the spider’s web are insects—a lot of insects . A British researcher once calculated that local farmland was home to more than two million spiders per acre , and that insects eaten annually by spiders nationwide would outweigh the human population . In fact , the change from ground-based webs to vertical , aerial webs was a reaction to the rise of winged insects . The increase in spiders in so many places is mainly because of their ability to move . To travel , a spider goes to a high point , lets out enough silk to catch the wind , and floats away . The spider may travel many miles this way . This helps them distance themselves from other spiders competing for food and also aids them in spinning a web across a gap they would otherwise have trouble crossing . Spiders release silk from silk glands called spigots to weave their webs . Hundreds of these spigots cover the three pairs of spinnerets that most spiders have . This allows spiders to combine multiple strands of silk into single threads with characteristics that differ for different uses . Some spiders , like tarantulas , only make one type of silk , but others make silk to use for drag lines , web frames , egg cases , or to trap insects . The webs also help spiders hide from predators such as birds . Other animals also make use of the spider’s web . A Hymenoepimecis wasp will attack a Plesiometa argyra spider and sting it . While the spider is paralyzed , the wasp deposits her egg on the spider’s abdomen . The spider goes about its business , catching and eating prey , while the wasp larva feeds on the spider’s blood .

0,MEAP_2005_8_28,"Read the article below and answer questions 27 through 29 . Spiders have been around for over 400 million years . Early spiders mainly used their silk to construct a hiding place . Today , although many spiders—such as giant tarantulas , trap-door spiders , and some other species—still use their silk mainly for shelter , most build various types of aerial webs . The primary victims of the spider’s web are insects—a lot of insects . A British researcher once calculated that local farmland was home to more than two million spiders per acre , and that insects eaten annually by spiders nationwide would outweigh the human population . In fact , the change from ground-based webs to vertical , aerial webs was a reaction to the rise of winged insects . The increase in spiders in so many places is mainly because of their ability to move . To travel , a spider goes to a high point , lets out enough silk to catch the wind , and floats away . The spider may travel many miles this way . This helps them distance themselves from other spiders competing for food and also aids them in spinning a web across a gap they would otherwise have trouble crossing . Spiders release silk from silk glands called spigots to weave their webs . Hundreds of these spigots cover the three pairs of spinnerets that most spiders have . This allows spiders to combine multiple strands of silk into single threads with characteristics that differ for different uses . Some spiders , like tarantulas , only make one type of silk , but others make silk to use for drag lines , web frames , egg cases , or to trap insects . The webs also help spiders hide from predators such as birds . Other animals also make use of the spider’s web . A Hymenoepimecis wasp will attack a Plesiometa argyra spider and sting it . While the spider is paralyzed , the wasp deposits her egg on the spider’s abdomen . The spider goes about its business , catching and eating prey , while the wasp larva feeds on the spider’s blood .
