From the spot where Rex was napping in the grassy yard, he had listened to the sound of the gate sliding open, and waited for it to snap shut. It didn't. The click of Sylvia's shoes faded into the distance, and yet the snap of the shutting gate didn't come. Finally, Rex pushed himself up on one paw so he could look towards the front of the yard, where the gate moved in the breeze. Rex moved slowly towards the gate at first, but as he neared the sidewalk he shot through the opening, his shiny black fur twinkling in the sun as he sped down the street. Rex ran from block to block through the neighborhood, with no leash to pull him back. When all four legs started to burn from running, Rex slowed down and started sniffing the grass around him. His stomach growled and he hoped he'd find some food in the grass. All he found was sidewalk chalk, a few little black ants, and flowers that made him sneeze. The sun was going down, and Rex thought about Sylvia coming home to rub his ears and fill his food bowl. He looked up and down the sidewalk for his home. Nothing. Rex was lost. He stood completely still and raised his ears as high as they would go. He sat and listened, and listened and sat.
