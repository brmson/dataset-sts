What are prions made of ?,1,"The disease , sporadic fatal insomnia , is caused by the same type of deformed proteins , known as prions , that cause mad cow disease and its human variant , Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease , according to two studies ."
What are prions made of ?,1,Prions are proteins with Jekyll-and-Hyde personalities that cluster in the brain .
What are prions made of ?,1,"The test , developed by private and government researchers , detects the presence of abnormal proteins called prions that cause a group of diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies , or TSE ."
What are prions made of ?,1,They would do this by using chimeraplasty to knock out the gene that makes proteins called prions in the sheep .
What are prions made of ?,1,"Unlike disease-causing viruses or bacteria , prions are normal proteins found throughout the body tissues of humans and other animals ."
What are prions made of ?,0,"Folded the wrong way , prions induce other proteins to mimic them ."

What are prions made of ?,0,"Generally , they are researchers who have made discoveries that sound small on paper but carry large consequences ."
What are prions made of ?,0,"When their molecules are folded into the correct shape , prions are benign , though no one knows their function ."
What are prions made of ?,0,"The misfolded prions then accumulate in parts of the brain , causing the tissue to break down and become full of holes , like a sponge ."
What are prions made of ?,0,Prions are still controversial .
What are prions made of ?,0,"However , the new studies add to evidence the infection is caused by the abnormal shape of the prions , not another agent , Drs ."
