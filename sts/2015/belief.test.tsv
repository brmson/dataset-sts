	health insurance should be treated with various cover options with everyone that seeks to have health care coverage paying for basic services.	it sounds as if your health care coverage rations in the exact same way that private health care does.
	he took two small papers with declining circulation in a small city in south australia and built a media empire and made himself on of the wealthiest men in the world.	we may get a call from a client saying that they need something and called another service as well..and the one who performs the quickest gets the order.
	well our money hungry goverment has found another pretext to sieze money from well meaning capitalists.	fdny is city government and they were on site since the planes hit.
	armed soldiers still patrol the capital, but discretely.	another uncle works at the janesville plant currently.
	in that speech he claimed the murder rate in flint michigan had more than doubled already.	the jihadists have little hope of being able to hijack any more planes so easily.
	for instance if we made cars without robots it would take 10x the manpower to produce what we now produce.	the reality is that they do exist and civil marriage brings with it large impacts on the transfer of property between spouses.
	lastly, i am amazed by your spin on the fact that half of americans don't pay federal income tax.	clearly the child had (has) a problem based on the fact that he committed murder.

0.60	if people need help, just assume charity and local gov'ts aren't enough and just tax everyone else to pay for it, what's the difference?	if millions have a disastrous medical issue, like cancer, or hundreds or thousands have a natural disaster issue, what's the difference?

	in that sense this is just the latest in a very long string of poor public relation and customer service incidents but this one is one of the stupider ones i've seen.	that's why the us has the largest prison population in the world, in both numbers, and as a percentage of the population.
0.00	chances are it will move more to the middle over time.	boycott as you deem fit, but calling for the death of the ceo is over the top.

	for the most part, i think the market should be allowed to set it's own price, but would agree that there does have to be a minimum wage of some kind.	he's an adult. he should be courteous to your home and keep it clean, but outside of that he should be able to come and go as he pleases.
	at least he didn't choose to carry a great big gun that killed his target, who was not committing any capital crime.	more often than not ows protestors are targeting their peers on the street rather than anyone who has committed any actual wrong doing.
	he still has a job becuase the city was unaffected...but he lost his home.	this thing has gone just exactly as the democrats hoped.
	this person is only going to get worse - not better.	there was nobody waiting for me to come home.

	is no consideration to be given to the crim?	why is no one sanctioning the us??
	but they have new truck every year, a huge custom and all their kids dive nice cars and go to state collages.	but whatever happens, we need some national truth-telling, and we need to stop calling "them" the problem.
	or maybe just a commutation of sentence like for scooter libby.	it may be a question of magnitude once again.

	it was my stepdad that had said "so and so died of a broken heart" and i would laugh.	hi, since bout a year after i started secondary school i've been getting this shoulder pain.

	new zealand beer is also acceptable, as new zealand is pound for pound the greatest sporting nation on earth and it can only be due to the beer.	we know the date this happened, because we know when mom and sister came home from the hospital, so i was two years and two months old at the time.
	some refused to go because they didn't want to be killed.	the rioters are pretty focused on the police and the president.
1.80	i agree with you about 'shouting about being different', what do you count as proclaiming difference?	i agree with you, quantum windbag, and so do most legal commentators i have read.
2.60	the international development secretary, hilary benn, the former health secretary alan milburn, and the leader of the commons, jack straw, are all at 25/1.	the foreign secretary, margaret beckett, is at 40/1, while the defence secretary, des browne, and the welsh and northern ireland secretary, peter hain are 50/1.
	* stop giving money belonging to we the people, away to the corrupt politicians of foreign governments.	it sounds horrible but feeding these people is the worst thing you can do in the long run.
	the way the system is designed, not much more than this is practically possible.	the father is not a public figure and is a private citizen.
	i don't know what to make of the whole thing to be honest..	i can't see his death reducing the scale of the 'war on terror'..
	but when it came to what i questioned?	to want to know he is safe ?
	so i have been looking around for somewhere else.	(i have been in full time employment for 25 years).
3.00	don't you follow, and want our laws to follow all of leviticus?	she's on line here but hasn't answered as to whether or not she follows all of leviticus, and whether or not she want's our nation's laws to follow all of leviticus.

	it is looking bad for ray right now.	meets dr. king; asks him for a job.
	i never had any luck with the temp agencies, one time i got a voice mail from one of them saying they had a job for me.	if they have made peace with their pay, then there is no reason you should not be at peace with their pay as well.
	always easy to blame others for your ineptitude.	they are with us for our lifetimes and beyond.
1.20	thus the need for health care insurance reform...the	is your health care rationed?
	does this sound fair?would the kids be happier with two fathers who love them than a man and woman where only one parent really loves them?	i think it would have helped me draw a line between the traumatic events of her death and funeral and marked the start of my learning to deal with life without mum.
	into actually rebuilding the country.	i dont have any dog in the fight.
	crony capitalism has been on the fore front of political debate for at least a few years now.	it's whether or not political rhetoric can cause people to do violence.
3.40	and of course it not ever their fault, as it's now fox news, the righties, blaa blaa blaa.	now of course its everyones fault but their own.

	false it is down 11%.	i would also not back down.
	she is so sensitive that even if i don;t eat dinner she gets in a mood and takes it personally!	there's two entities that have zero interest in keeping obama in the white house.
	we didn't really get anywhere so he dropped me home and told me to go and that it would be a 50 50 decision to split.	now - they are dangerous - cos they would move to another bottle, and it would all begin again.
	i was in and out of the wards, civilian and va 2 or 3 times a year from 96 to 2000.	william hill have cut the odds on the prime minister leaving this year from 5/1 to 9/4.
	after college i, like many others at the time, felt a compulsion to change what we saw as inequalities in the world and became a social worker.	i saw her all the time and we spoke about 6 times a day on the phone up until she was very ill in her last weeks and sleepy with morphine.
	i asked if they had showed him the time as he needs visual prompts and she said 'i told him he had 10 minutes' i asked if she showed him 10 minutes and she said no.	he invited me in the past (while simultaneously saying i should be tried and executed), and i told him that i believe he is mentally ill and needs help, not attention.
	usually, there is only 1 us at 20 weeks with my midwife unless there are other circumstances.	unfortunately they're going to end up at the same address six feet under - they be pals or israelis.

	you think this whole thread is conspiracy theory bs?	why do you think that commandment is there?
0.80	or like oil companies, who have a cartel.	true oil only comes from quart sized cans.
	that is exactly what happened: no, it isn't, unless you believe that the instant vaporization of hundreds of thousands of people can be written off because of their nationality.	they report that there are no planes coming in or out, and that there are tens of thousands of people at the airport.
	again, you daft cunt, i'm not rich and i get great health coverage.	i wouldnt be able to change to a buy to let mortgage.

	common sense tells us that bankers that have to sell their third vacation home are the one's with entitlement issues.	however my cash flow is better with them then without since the rental income more than covers the mortgages on them plus...
2.00	i don't actually give two figs what minimum wage does for or against the economy.	the idea of regular increments to minimum wage is a good one - for businesses to cope with them.
	thank god for the 99%ers' they seem to understand the system is rigged.	then i found others that countered what she said.
	so it is a big deal that they are coming.	so now it is a fight for freedom of choice.
1.60	the tea party didn't promote ending the intereference of religion in politics.	in this case it is the freedom of choice vs. the freedom of religion.
	there, now, isn't that more literate than 'lying racist'...	therefore, it was christians that did it!"
	you must have seen zona's post on the other thread.	you wouldn't have an original thought if it hit you in the face.

	i believe this man gets it.	if they dont want to.
	he is an ex-ecb vice president.	this was an accident...
	the detective in charge hasn't answered phone calls and his bag hasn't been returned to him, which contained business papers and clothes.	the deficit is a result of borrowing to save the collapse of the banking system, not because labour invested too much money into our services.
	pakistani military, isi or the nwo order?	as we stand there is no will that we know of anywhere.
	the lawmakers choice to bail out the banks is an entirely separate issue of accountability.	what the police have to find out now is if zimmerman instigated the confrontation.
	bloodletting is not a valid medical treatment, either.	the father is not a public figure and is a private citizen.
	i think the lakotas never expected to win in court..ray	i'm shocked he was even elected...
	seems to me you would want them to make money in order to have money in order to clean up this mess..	also, penn state fans are being encouraged to wear white to the next game in order to protest the persecution of paterno and express their support.
	i curse worse than a sailor so i felt it was best to think about those choice words for her.	oil is washing up north of miamui beach on the east side of florida.
	who said zimmerman is a victim?	wow that vor person is a idiot!
2.20	the rich don't need cobra, they can buy their own individual policy at any price...so	the poor don't need cobra to continue being insured, they never were insured by their employers, they have medicaid.
	this development is interesting because it raises a lot of fascinating questions about economic management.	and i don't even engage in the practice of being "vague" about the description of my inventory.
2.40	how will conservatives respond to the issues?	but conserv won't address these issues.
	exactly how awesome are you, anyway?	just what are you reading?
	do we want iran to become the next north korea?	all of that proves that zimmerman told the police the truth.
	it's a human endeavor.	and that's a tall order.
0.00	ground/home deliver tues thru sat...	they didn't even have a train station...
2.20	a recent example is how a federal court rejected a lawsuit based on "national security."	upon his release he sued the us for the above crimes and the case was dismissed for "national security reasons."
1.00	my mum married the other man and stayed with him until he died.	my dad met a lovely woman and also remarried.
	it make sense to at least release one proper picture of bin laden too to silence all the critics?	and our population hasn't increased by over a factor of 10 in the last two generations.
	i agreed to marry him.	you will learn to make real chips.
	its hard to understand why the brits would desire to be assimilated into the eu.	i think there are numerous instances where our justice system is simply too punitive.
	people who design the robots.	perhaps we knew each other.
	they leave that pathetic shite to cnn & nbc.	other than that, i'm afraid there's not much else you can do.
	:/ after reading through the posts in this thread, isn't the main issue one where british nationals are being denied the right to come here.	leviticus 18:24, 30 reads, "defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which i cast out before you.
	"all i want is a chevrolet."	denial is not just a river in egypt.
	i wasnt trying to make him feel bad.	not sure if he truly meant it or was trying to make me feel better - but it did work.
	you wouldn't have an original thought if it hit you in the face.	such people aren't capable of rational thought and only understand violence.
	i have a brother and sister that do not speak to me and they think this was a brilliant way to get back at me (believe it or not!!).	i am sure the counsellors there have seen so many manipulators and the fallout that they may be able to suggest strategies to cope.
	the politics of congress).	that is how it works.
	who said anything about the csi program, genius.	i have family waiting in the cairo airport right now.
	why do you think that commandment is there?	why do wingnuts hate intelligence?
	i think this is a political not current event thread.	i wouldn't say it's racist, just insular great thread.
	president bush became the first president to spend 3 percent of gdp on federal antipoverty programs.	some members of the president's staff were indited and sent to prison for perjury and other offenses.
	it seems like every time something goes on between my husband and i that his friends have to get involved or make rude comments.	it seems like the best option would have been something like "hey, i think this violin is fake and paypal is saying i have to destroy it to get my money back.
	it may destabilize the gulf for a while, but in the long run it will prove to be fruitful.	if the government provides health care, whether spelled out in this bill or not, it will ration the care.
0.00	our justice system is rotten to the core, so what are we going to do about it?	do you think she just told you not to bother because you just had a baby not to long ago?
	if you want to learn absolutely nothing, whilst watching the poor old teacher trying to play a role that largely consists of being a jail warden, then go to a comprehensive.	if you want to change society's morals you appeal to the hearts and minds of the people that are willing to listen and if they embrace it what you find to be immoral will eventually die out on it's own.
	i don't need you to state whether you've excused it or not, by your actions its clear that you have.	i don't mean to be dense, but why do you have to find out what his long term intentions are?
	they are the voice and interpreters of this tort and did their duty.	there are a few other early memories, but i can't date them.
	only caught this thread tonight, but yay for you and the date!	both daughtes had to go to cafcass for inteviews.
	does it automatically get split between me and my sisters or do we have to try and track down this other will?	i have 3 kids between 7 and 2, my sister has a daughter aged 10 months.
	she actually asked me if i had a can of pumpkin for back up.	she acts like she had no idea who she was praising.
3.00	this has been so usual for us that i can bring her home and not change her again til 6:30 or 7 and her diaper is still peed in but not full at all.	whenever we pick her up from all but one of the teachers, her sheet says she was changed at 4:30ish and when i change her again at 6:30 or 7 her diaper is fine.
	(this is in primary by the way).	i didnt do as well at stanford, by the way.
	in your own mind, maybe, outside of it, the word may take on a different meaning.	my brother is an alcoholic, with 2 daughters from 2 different marriages.
1.60	in actual practise, the clinics tend to keep the embryos on ice because they fear law suits.	in their view, there is a difference between an embryo and a brain dead person.
	i told him not to come back, but i know yet again i will take him back.	she told me of her son, then in vietnam, and her wish to bring him home.
0.20	conventional weapons may not even be able to hit some of the fortified facilities either.	obviously you're totally ignorant as to the make up of the people participating in the protests.

	in any case, the basis of the thread is still shot to hell.	he was the first speaker of the house in history to be fined.
	no atomic bombs, no surrender.	the atomic bombs were not ready until summer 1945.
	it does exist, and it's a fucking crime.	i cant stand to smell of cooking food.
	newt's relations with women are at best reprehensible.	it's just who we are as a society.
	it simply covers the things we have been talking about.	quite simply because they're pissing on the graves of those who died.
	this is england, we are a 3rd world dumping ground for some reason..	so i have been looking around for somewhere else.
	i know when the only solution is to spend trillions for minimal, unproven benefit, i know the liar is a leftist.	however, i might try to find someone with the means and skills to investigate the position because i do think it has merit.
3.40	so if the jury was in fact instructed incorrectly, chances are they will not come to the correct conclusion.	the jury is to be instructed as to the law to be applied to the facts they determine, not the other way around.
	the problem i have here is that the wbc's site isn't a memorial site for matthew snyder, it is their own property to disseminate their point of view.	however, there is no drama that he was involved with anna chapman or any other honey pot involved with russian or us mafias.
	the former home secretary charles clarke is the outsider at 66/1.	the nurse needs a scientific calculator to take your pulse.
0.00	but our parents said "oh no, it was an accident".	it was our day, how we wanted and it was wonderful.
	michigan is also considered mitt's home state.	main issue i see is identity.
	the world police can send troops to surround the criminals, but there are no easy and clean options to go in without either of the armed forces massacring a lot of the hostages too.	he does have lots of really interesting ideas about the economy and the us's relations with the rest of the world that are worth listening to.
	there are no groups of right wingers dancing in the streets waving signs that say "death to liberals!"	they said there was fighting amongst kids in the street and this seemed to be normal and tolerated.
	president bush presided over a $2.5 trillion increase in the public debt through 2008.	president obama has proposed a $634 billion down payment on a new govern*ment health care fund.
	i along with other christians will bow to allah (who is the same god i worship anyway) and watch the fireworks.	it's their choice as to what services they will provide and what they won't.
	the constant stream of pinocchios he has gotten from the washington post, on easily checked facts, demonstrates this.	the first baptist church in his hometown had to take up a collection to support the family gingrich had deserted.
	i want to thank all of you who participated and also craven for giving us the opportunity.	i don't actually give two figs what minimum wage does for or against the economy.
	wait, see and hoard cash.	hold, straighten and push forward again.
	you sit in front of one of mankind's greatest inventions.	he's going the full marxist route of attacking creative destruction.
	the kid is a monster with no respect for human life.	all the while i was bummed i didn't get to make anything else.
	the international alliance did not release further details.	she then said she could not give me their number.
	ann coulter didn't laugh.	and it didnt bother me.
	in their view, there is a difference between an embryo and a brain dead person.	i don't believe most progressives even understand the difference between the state and federal government.
0.20	yes, there are many variables that affect prices, and trying to explain it through one company is not realistic.	also, there are hints that these concerns are from scientists who only want to fund their own pet projects.
	do not pay attention to the evidence!	so you may want to consider my advice.
	that was also about a blow job, of course.	he was caught lying to congress.

	perhaps its time for budget and personel cuts in the justice dept if all you have to do is bust for weed.	it wasn't fun really, but if you need to be induced then you have to do what you need to do.
	we called the campgrounds and the owners said they had cleaned our campsite and did not find anything.	he and the democrats got damn near everything they wanted and they still reneged on it before the ink was dry.
	bullies "attempted" to beat me up while the other kids looked on and helped the bullies.	people are facing choices about whether to ruin their lives - or potentially lose their lives.
1.00	or does anyone know any way i could help it?	has anyone heard about this?
	laws should be for everyone.	we could go tit for tat over and over.
	since being made redundant i have worked really hard at both getting the house together and finding another job.	one thing they found particularly hard to deal with was other young men attaching themselves to their group and being undislodgeable (a nwe word and it's only 9 am!).
	as for his pension, would that not have been sorted when he divorced your mum?	as for the forensics, do you think the world works like csi?
	the left is fighting for freedom of choice.	there is strong demand for us education.
0.00	the president's biological father was kenyan, and obama barely knew him.	the justice system is a farce and we all know it.

	we have shed thousands of lives in iraq and afghanistan and what have we accomplished?	he has texted the house phone last night and all the kids.
	anyone that has a nickel in their pocket has a part in controlling commerce.	ows has already launched the class war into the consciousness of millions of americans.
	practically, nobody cared.	i fully and totally agree.
	it appears that, though you claim to value education - we must have very different understandings of what the word 'education' means also.	the arab league did not understand that a no fly zone can have different meanings if worded appropriately.
	i just wondered if anyone else had been in the same situation and could offer me some advice so i can move forward from this.	i have suffered from anxiety and depression in the past and she was the one person who could calm me down and make everything alright.
	in america we have a thing called due process.	do you know the great thing about numbers.
	i already showed you that there has been no decrease in outgoing lw radiation since 1970 according to the satellite record in spite of a marked increase in atmospheric co2.	i agree that there has to be a reasonable amount of secrecy in a case like this.
	they are a pissed off and unaffiliated new breed of political monster that no one knows what to make of yet.	as to the rest of that lunatic ranting and political positioning on whitehouse.gov,
	got in and out with relative ease the last time i went.	he got bin laden from a place that bush didn't dare to go into.
	this won't be the last rise in tuition fees.	that was the ultimate insult to him.
	what are scientists who are educated in how to treat and prevent the problem going to do?	but there is nothing that you are willing to do that will rectify the problem.
	i think there is a broader view of holding people accountable that your conveniently ignore with your argument.	i think there are a number of high-profile crimes where criminals are held long long after the point where they are a danger to anyone.
	three of the seals being rescued were also killed and the fourth wounded.	even our r&d is being jobbed-out to faraway india and other parts of the world.
0.00	it gives me just as good a reason never to use ebay.	just how good a basis is revenge for sentencing?
	as unions usually do, they chose keeping their benefits at the level they are, over keeping cops on the job, and the lay offs happened.	unions are for those that have no other skill other than a 5th grade educated worker has with a hammer in their hand.
2.20	i really dont know what to do...	i don't really know what is up but i'm super mad about it.
	it's kind of scary but the thing is he wants to be caught, he's just making people work to catch him.	it is a national campaign that wants people to stop snitchin' on people who commit crimes.
	are they not a media company interesting in keeping the populate updated on the latest and greatest and hottest news?	actually, the whole "contraception" drum is being pounded by the liberals in an attempt at gotcha politics.
0.00	the bush administration put them back in.	they didn't get it, but they asked for it.
	i chose to allow him to do so.	i heard about this two weeks ago.
	i wonder whether khadaffi's move heralds a new direction in the realtionship between the west and the formerly anti-us arab nations.	he does have lots of really interesting ideas about the economy and the us's relations with the rest of the world that are worth listening to.
	the conversation turned to politics, which led eventually to a rather silly looking woman (rslw) saying that she hated the bnp.	the verses above from leviticus are in a section of the bible that lists immoral acts and the penalties for them.
	wher the women even those pregnant were not allowed any breaks except a 30 minute lunch perid.	we then gave our insurance company the crime ref number and the receipts of the items stolen.
	it was so secret that james bamford was able to write a book about in 1982, the puzzle palace.	it was my stepdad that had said "so and so died of a broken heart" and i would laugh.
	oh my god, you really are a racist aren't you?	why do you hate america so much?
0.00	until two days ago, i didn't know they actually made guns for kids (and i'm not talking about toy guns).	source thomas do you have data on how the insurance industry is preparing for or speaking about gw?
	i do appreciate the fact this shooter was not charged or detained, since he was acting within his understanding of the laws we have now.	i lost my mum and i felt the same way, for quite a long time, so i think i understand how it is for you.
	even though i do work, but he is the one that pays the majority of our bills.	i think they could at least specify the varity of apple used.
	i will say that i have never found an article on the milwaukee voucher program that proves it's working.	they are literally saying that going above one's superiors is worse than going to the police once one's superiors take action.
	the high court declared the case against the machines moot since the justice department has now cleared the machines, and ordered another part back to court to decide a fight over attorney fees.	both sides could have used better attorneys on this, the arguments dance around the real issues and ignore the facts - on both sides.
	problem i see is not the color of people that live in here and not from where they come.	problem is clinton did something no other president did, he violated the oval office by having sex thaere and then lying about it.
	that's why i no longer laugh at them.	it's not like he needs the money.
	we created 11 million jobs.	they saved millions of lives.
	i still like you, but i am beginning to wonder why.	we still have not got a decision from them.
	the vote for gay marriage is about to happen in maine.	people still care about what happened, i do.
	sorry to rant about gypsies so much, but there is so few that listen, i take my chances whenever i can.	i am sorry for this news to you but this has been the case since...well,
	this september i left home, and started at university.	they had to be air lifted in somewhere around the first of june.
	i am also reading about that recently (e.g.	if not, stop talking about due process.
	they never get presidential attendence do they?	but the police have to do something, don't they?
	this contraception thing is nothing but a new shiny object to distract the easily distracted and unfocused republicans.	the first baptist church in his hometown had to take up a collection to support the family gingrich had deserted.
0.00	actually, it's people who build the robots since not enough are being made to create an assembly line.	of course, people who work with sick animals know that when the mean ones stop being mean, death is peeking around the corner.
	police say that's a standard practice whenever a taser is used.	sounds like we are falling foul of the eu standard practice in the way we treat our nationals.
	totally free of course.	obama agreed and compromised.
	but at least i'll have peace of mind that he's ok.	thanks i think it can be very easy to focus on what he doesn't do.

	aig gets bailed out, then gives multi-million dollar bonuses in the very same year.	here is a partial list: - the stimulus has created millions of jobs in the private sector.
	in russia, 56% positively evaluate the work of obama.	i am positively surprised about this choice.
	this, had we be wiling to talk about it seriously at the time, would have been legitimate cause for concern.	had that been on the 5.30pm from victoria it would have been a goner.
	they might be hiding him or something, in which case what is the problem?	i said i complain the 3 or so times a month i ring with the same problem.
	at least that is my hope.	@edgarblythe, that is very sad.
4.60	why didn't we ever hear about it during the bush admin when during his admin the national debt was more than doubled?	but they never mentioned the doubling of the national debt under the bush admin.

	the solution will not or should not be requesting a schedule change for ms.i.	the net result would be devastating to the poorest of the poor.
	the majority of this nation believes in god and believes that he will turn on us.	as to the rest of that lunatic ranting and political positioning on whitehouse.gov,
	hopefully you have been declaring this income to the taxman?	why do you hate people that work in their own home?
	what kind of history do the us have then?	what did you edit out?
	in fact, watching fox will tell you the exact opposite of what you are claiming.	try dealing with the facts instead of your wishful thinking.

	hiya all -long posting alert!!!!	why all the lying about this on your part?
	while i'm sure mr schlesinger enjoyed taking a swipe at the departed mr bush, he adds nothing to the debate.	the story that a soldier related to larry king about how he died is now known to be a false.

0.00	best wishes, yes he had an affair.	reality is, i was there before and returned again.

	but it's also possible that something more mysterious is going on.	that's about the limit of my understanding of this crazy, glowing box.)
0.60	it helps that the media hasn't given him the same anal-probing the gop field has gotten.	the problem is that this man was violent and abused me beating me and generally hurting me.
